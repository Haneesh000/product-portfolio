                (the “Policy”). This is the legal basis upon which we process your personal information as well. It is

        <h4>THIS IS THE INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT ABOUT YOU</h4>

        <h6>1.Information you provide if you decide to contact us</h6>
        <p>If you contact us (by phone or email or through an App), we may keep a record of that. If you report a
            problem with
            a Website or an App, we may keep that information. The information which you provide and we keep may include
            your name,
            address, telephone number and/or email address.</p>

        <h6>2.Information we collect about you when you use a Website</h6>
        <p>When you use a Website, we use technology such as that provided by Google Analytics to collect information
            about your visit to that Website. This includes the pages you visit and how long you spend on the Website.
            You can find more information about Google Analytics here: www.google.com/analytics.</p>

        <h6>3.Information we collect about you when you download an App</h6>
        <p>We sometimes may ask you for information after you have downloaded an App, but before you start using it.
            This may include contact details such as your email address, personal details such as your Facebook Id or
            name, or demographic details such as your gender, date of birth or profession. Some of this information is
            required (eg email address) and some are optional (eg profession). What we collect is slightly different
            depending
            upon whether you choose to login using Facebook or not.</p>

        <h6>4.Information we may collect when you use an App</h6>
        <p>We collect information when you use our Apps on how you use those Apps and how you play the games in them.
            For example,
            we will note how you interact with our games, how you perform and what scores you achieve. We also take note
            of when you
            choose to share your achievements with friends on Facebook and if you choose to pay for versions of our Apps
            such as KettleMind Pro.</p>

        <h6>5.Information we may collect about the device you use to access and use an App</h6>
        <p>When you use our Apps we collect information about your device such as its IP address, what model it is and a
            device ID.</p>


        <h4>THIS IS WHO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH </h4>
        <p style="line-height:1.7">We will only share information with other organisations where we have your permission
            to do so in accordance with this
            Policy, where we believe it is necessary for a legitimate reason connected with an App or a Website, or
            where it is necessary for us to comply with
            the terms and conditions of that App or Website. We will only share information with a third party if we are
            satisfied that such third party will
            keep that information secure.<br><br>

            We work with analytics providers such as Google Analytics which may involve information about your use of a
            Website and/or an App been processed by
            Google.<br><br>

            We work with Facebook to allow you to sign in for Apps using the credentials that you have with that
            company. We also enable you to share your
            performances when using our Apps with your Facebook friends. This involves Facebook processing some of your
            information. It also results in some
            of your information becoming public, so do read Facebook’s privacy policy and be careful with what you
            share.<br>

            Finally, we may disclose your personal information to third parties:<br>
        </p>
        <p>if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal or
            regulatory obligation or request;<br>
            to enforce or apply our terms of use/terms and conditions and other agreements or to investigate potential
            breaches; or<br>
            to protect the rights, property or safety of a Website and/or App, or of our users.</p><br>




        <br>
        <h4>OUR USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER IDENTIFIERS</h4>
        <p>Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on your computer, mobile phone or other device. They do lots
            of different jobs, like
            letting you navigate between pages efficiently, storing your preferences, and generally improving your
            experience of a Website. Cookies
            make the interaction between you and a Website faster and easier. The only cookies we use are from Google
            Analytics which distinguish you
            from other users of the Website. The cookie distinguishing you in this way lasts for two years. This helps
            us to provide you with a good
            experience when you use the Website and also allows us to improve the Website. We do not use them on Apps.
        </p>
        <p>In some cases, we use device identifiers called ‘IDFA's‘ which operate like cookies. We provide Facebook with
            an ‘IDFA’ to improve our
            targeting of ads on Facebook when we are trying to acquire customers for our products.</p>

        <p>Please refer to your device’s help material to learn what controls you can use to remove cookies, block
            cookies, or disable IDFA tracking.
            If you do this, it may affect your use of a Website or an App.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>KEEPING INFORMATION SECURE</h4>
        <p>We make reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Information, but no company, including Hamara Labs PVT
            LTD., can fully eliminate security
            risks connected to handling information on the internet. Moreover, we can't be in charge of any of your
            Personal Information that you discharge
            with anyone else, or that you ask for or approve us to discharge.</p>
